Regular (constant gradient moment) EPG
======================================

In the regular EPG model, the dephasing order is reduced to a unitless integer :math:`k\ge 0` which represents a multiplicative factor of some arbitrary basic dephasing. The implementation of regular EPG in Sycomore has two high-level operations: :meth:`sycomore.Regular.apply_pulse` to simulate an RF hard pulse and :meth:`sycomore.Regular.apply_time_interval` which simulates relaxation, diffusion and dephasing due to gradients. The lower-level EPG operators used by :meth:`sycomore.Regular.apply_time_interval` are also accessible as :meth:`sycomore.Regular.relaxation`, :meth:`sycomore.Regular.diffusion` and :meth:`sycomore.Regular.shift`. The states of the model are stored in :attr:`sycomore.Regular.states`, and the fully-focused magnetization (i.e. :math:`F_0`) is stored in :attr:`sycomore.Regular.echo`.

For simulations involving multiple gradient moments (all multiple of a given gradient moment), the "unit" gradient moment must be declared when creating the model; for simulations involving only a single gradient moment, this declaration is optional, but should be present nevertheless.

The following code sample simulates the evolution of the signal in an `RF- & gradient spoiled GRE`_ experiment.


.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot 
    import numpy
    import sycomore
    from sycomore.units import *
    
    species = sycomore.Species(1000*ms, 1000*ms)
    flip_angle=30*deg
    TE = 5*ms
    TR = 25*ms
    phase_step = 117*deg
    slice_thickness = 1*mm
    G_readout = 2*numpy.pi*rad / (sycomore.gamma*slice_thickness)
    
    model = sycomore.epg.Regular(species, unit_gradient_area=G_readout)
    repetitions = int((4*species.T1/TR))
    
    echo = numpy.zeros(repetitions, dtype=complex)
    for r in range(0, repetitions):
        phase = (phase_step * 1/2*(r+1)*r)
        
        model.apply_pulse(flip_angle, phase)
        model.apply_time_interval(TE)
        
        rewind = numpy.exp(-1j*phase.convert_to(rad))
        echo[r] = model.echo*rewind
        
        model.apply_time_interval(TR-TE, G_readout/(TR-TE))




Once the echo signal has been gathered for all repetitions, its magnitude and phase can be plotted using respectively `numpy.abs`_ and `numpy.angle`_.
